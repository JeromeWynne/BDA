# BDA_010

# Censored and uncensored data in the exponential model:
# (a) Suppose y|theta is exponentially distributed with rate theta,
#     and the marginal distribution of theta is Gamma(alpha, beta). Suppose
#     we observe that y >= 10, but do not observe the exact value of y.
#     What is the posterior distribution, p(theta|y >= 100), as a function of
#     alpha and beta? Write down the posterior mean and vairance of theta.
