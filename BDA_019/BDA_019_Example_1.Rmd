The stationary distribution of a\footnote{irreducible (it is possible to move between any two states in a finite number of steps) and aperiodic (all states in the chain have a period of 1)} Markov chain describes the fraction of time spent in each recurrent state after the chain has been run for a long time. This distribution is denoted $s$: it corresponds to the marginal distribution at every step in a steady process. The rows of $Q$ on the other hand, represent the probability of each state, conditional on a current state.

\[
  Q = \begin{bmatrix}
      0   & 0   & 1 & 0 \\
      0   & 0   & 0 & 1 \\
      2/3 & 1/3 & 0 & 0 \\
      1/3 & 2/3 & 0 & 0
      \end{bmatrix}
\]

```{r}
Q <- matrix(c(0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2/3, 1/3, 0, 0, 1/3, 2/3, 0, 0),
            nrow = 4, ncol = 4, byrow = TRUE)
x <- c(0.5, 0.25, 0.25, 0)
n <- 50
state_sequence <- matrix(0, nrow = n, ncol = 1)
for (j in seq(n)) {
  state_sequence[j] <- sample(seq(4), 1, prob = x)
  x <- x %*% Q
}
{plot(seq(n), state_sequence, xlab = 'Step #', ylab = 'State', type = 'p', pch = 20)
lines(seq(n), state_sequence, lwd = 1)}
